## Create Readme

You have to create a `Readme.md` file. and write down following questions. Dont Try to copy paste from AI Tools. Just write what you know about these. If you don't know , then search , learn , understand and then write.

### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

 Ans: getElementById = Selects one element with a specific ID, getElementsByClassName = Selects all elements with a class and Returns an HTMLCollection like an array, querySelector = Selects the first element that matches any CSS selector, querySelectorAll = Selects all elements that match a CSS selector. Returns a NodeList.

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

 Ans: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
       newDiv.textContent = "Hello World!";
       newDiv.className = "myClass";
       document.body.appendChild(newDiv);

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
    
  Ans: When an element is clicked, the event starts from the innermost element and bubbles up to its parent, then grandparent, all the way to the document.

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

   Ans: Letting a parent element handle events for its children instead of adding listeners to each child.

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

   Ans: preventDefault() Stops the default browser action (like form submission0) and stopPropagation() Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
